<font size = '5' color ='grey'>Data visualization matters, because it helps human brain to understand and detect patterns, trends, and outliers in the data. Data visualization is a subject of art, because there is a large amount of plot types, and each one has its own magic. For example, bar chart can show the proportion and line chart can easily show the trend. There are so many data visualization tools, for instance, R, Python, Tableau, Power BI, etc. </font>
